# React

This project is a learning environment for React (frontend) and Python (backend) development.

## Features

- React-based frontend
- Python backend (e.g., Flask or Django)
- Practice full-stack development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Python 3.x

### Installation

there's no genuine reason to install this, as this is a test project. I'm going to embed this in a docker image soon to make it more readily utilizable  (and, to also learn docker)
